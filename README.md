# TURTLE-GRAPHICS-PYTHON
Patterns Using Turtle In Python
The turtle has three attributes: a location, an orientation (or direction), and a pen. The pen, too, has attributes: color, width, and on/off state.

The turtle moves with commands that are relative to its own position, such as "move forward 10 spaces" and "turn left 90 degrees". The pen carried by the turtle can also be controlled, by enabling it, setting its color, or setting its width. A student could understand (and predict and reason about) the turtle's motion by imagining what they would do if they were the turtle.
A full turtle graphics system requires control flow, procedures, and recursion: many turtle drawing programs fall short. From these building blocks one can build more complex shapes like squares, triangles, circles and other composite figures.
The ideas behind turtle graphics can be extended to include three-dimensional space. This is achieved by using one of several different coordinate models. If the turtle operates in cylindrical coordinates, then it has a location and a heading within its plane, and its plane may be rotated around the vertical axis. This often manifests itself as the turtle having two different heading angles, one within the plane and the other determining the plane's angle. Usually changing the plane's angle does not move the turtle.
